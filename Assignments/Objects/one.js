//? Why do we use objects?

/*In JavaScript, an object is a collection of properties, where each 
property is defined as a key-value pair. Objects are used to store and 
organize data in a structured and flexible way. */

/*Objects are fundamental in JavaScript and are used extensively for 
various reasons due to their flexibility and capability to store a wide 
range of data types and structures.*/

//?Some key reasons for using objects:
//Structured Data Storage: Store related data together in key-value pairs.
//Dynamic Properties: Easily add, modify, and access properties using dot or bracket notation.
//Methods and Functionality: Encapsulate data and behavior together with methods.
//Complex Data Structures: Represent complex data structures, including nested objects and arrays.
//JSON (JavaScript Object Notation): Basis for JSON, a common data interchange format.
//Prototypal Inheritance: Enable inheritance and reusable components through prototypes.
//State Management: Manage state in applications, especially in front-end frameworks.
//Flexible Key Types: Support for string and symbol keys, allowing advanced meta-programming.
//Extensibility: Easily extend objects with new properties and methods as needed.
//Interoperability: Work seamlessly with built-in JavaScript methods and browser APIs.
